		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Rust/Bevy Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into: creating the Rust project structure, configuring Bevy dependencies for both native and WASM targets, setting up the build toolchain for WebAssembly, creating the module structure for game components, and setting up the web serving infrastructure",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task involves multiple configuration steps across different tools (cargo, wasm-bindgen, web setup) and requires proper module organization from the start"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Card Data Structures and Deck Logic",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: defining card enums and structs, implementing the deck with initialization and shuffling, creating hand management logic with capacity constraints, and implementing the table pile structure",
			"reasoning": "This is mostly straightforward data structure implementation with well-defined requirements. The main complexity is ensuring proper ownership and borrowing patterns in Rust"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design Core Game State Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: designing the GameState struct, implementing Bevy ECS components for game entities, creating state transition systems, implementing turn management, adding state validation logic, and integrating with Bevy's scheduling system",
			"reasoning": "Integrating game state with Bevy's ECS paradigm requires careful design. Managing state transitions, validation, and ensuring thread-safe access in an ECS context adds complexity"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Kseri Game Rules Engine",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: implementing move validation logic, creating card collection mechanics, handling special Kseri scoring rules, implementing multi-round dealing logic, and creating the final scoring calculator",
			"reasoning": "While Kseri rules are relatively simple, implementing them correctly with all edge cases, special scoring, and proper integration with the game state requires careful attention to detail"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Card Rendering and Visual Assets",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: sourcing or creating card visual assets, implementing card entity rendering with Bevy sprites, creating responsive layout systems for different screen areas, implementing proper z-ordering for overlapping cards, and handling window resize events",
			"reasoning": "Requires both asset creation/sourcing and technical implementation of responsive layouts. Bevy's rendering system has a learning curve, and making it responsive adds complexity"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Card Animation System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: creating the core animation system with tweening, implementing dealing animations, adding play-to-table animations, creating collection animations with special effects, implementing shuffle visualization, and handling animation interruptions/queuing",
			"reasoning": "Animation systems require careful state management, especially when handling interruptions and queuing. Creating smooth, appealing animations in Bevy while maintaining performance is moderately complex"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Player Input and Interaction System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: implementing mouse click detection on cards, adding hover states and visual feedback, creating drag-and-drop mechanics, implementing turn-based input blocking, and adding touch support for mobile browsers",
			"reasoning": "Input handling in a web context with both mouse and touch, combined with game state validation and visual feedback, requires careful coordination between multiple systems"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Design Game UI and HUD Elements",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: implementing the UI layout system, creating player information displays, adding game status indicators, and ensuring responsive scaling across different screen sizes",
			"reasoning": "UI implementation in Bevy is relatively straightforward, but ensuring good responsive design and clear information display requires attention to user experience details"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement WebSocket Client in WASM",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: setting up web-sys WebSocket bindings, implementing the message protocol with serialization, creating connection lifecycle management, implementing reconnection logic with backoff, handling WASM-specific async patterns, and ensuring browser compatibility",
			"reasoning": "WebSocket implementation in WASM involves complex FFI bindings, async handling in a WASM context, and robust error handling for network issues. The reconnection logic adds additional state management complexity"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Build WebSocket Game Server",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: setting up tokio-tungstenite server, implementing client connection management, creating game session pairing logic, implementing authoritative game state management, adding move validation, creating state broadcast system, and handling disconnection/reconnection scenarios",
			"reasoning": "Building a reliable multiplayer game server involves complex concurrent programming, state synchronization, connection management, and error handling. The authoritative server model requires careful validation logic"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Game State Synchronization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: designing the state synchronization protocol, implementing delta compression, creating client-side prediction logic, implementing server reconciliation, adding sequence number handling, managing latency compensation, and handling edge cases in state conflicts",
			"reasoning": "State synchronization is one of the most complex aspects of multiplayer games. Implementing prediction, reconciliation, and handling network issues while maintaining a responsive feel requires sophisticated algorithms"

			"taskTitle": "Create Game Flow and Screens",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: implementing the name selection screen, creating the waiting room with connection status, building the game-over screen with results, adding screen transition logic, and handling edge cases in game flow",
			"reasoning": "Screen management is relatively straightforward, but coordinating with network state and handling edge cases like mid-game disconnections requires careful state management"
