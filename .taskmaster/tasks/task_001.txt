# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Rust/Bevy Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial Rust project with Bevy game engine and configure it for WebAssembly compilation
# Details:
Create a new Rust project using cargo. Add Bevy as a dependency with WASM support. Set up the basic project structure with separate modules for game logic, networking, and UI. Configure Cargo.toml with necessary dependencies including bevy, wasm-bindgen, web-sys for browser APIs, and tokio-tungstenite for WebSocket support. Create wasm build configuration and basic index.html template for serving the game.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project compiles to both native and WASM targets. Test that a basic Bevy window opens in the browser when served via a local web server. Ensure all dependencies are properly resolved.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Rust project structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new Rust project with cargo and set up the basic directory structure for a Bevy game
### Details:
Run `cargo new kseri --bin` to create the project. Create directories for assets/, src/components/, src/systems/, src/resources/, and web/ for organizing game code and web deployment files

## 2. Configure Bevy dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add Bevy and related dependencies to Cargo.toml with proper feature flags for both native and WASM targets
### Details:
Add bevy = "0.14" with features = ["dynamic_linking"] for development. Configure target-specific dependencies using [target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies] for wasm-bindgen and web-sys. Add bevy_egui for UI and other common Bevy plugins

## 3. Set up WebAssembly build toolchain [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install and configure the necessary tools for building Rust to WebAssembly
### Details:
Install wasm-pack with `cargo install wasm-pack`. Add rust target with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Create a build script or Makefile for WASM compilation with proper flags like --target web and optimization settings

## 4. Create module structure for game components [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement the initial module structure and basic game components following Bevy's ECS pattern
### Details:
Create mod.rs files for components, systems, and resources modules. Implement a basic App setup in main.rs with DefaultPlugins. Create placeholder modules for player, enemy, physics, and ui components. Set up proper module exports and imports

## 5. Set up web serving infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create the HTML template and web server setup for serving the WASM build
### Details:
Create index.html with proper canvas element and WASM loading script. Set up a simple HTTP server configuration (using python or node). Create a wasm-bindgen output directory structure. Configure proper CORS headers and MIME types for WASM files
