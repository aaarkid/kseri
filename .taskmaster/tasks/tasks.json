The calculate_card_transform function intelligently assigns z-values based on card location and index within that location. Table cards implement a cascading effect where each subsequent card receives a higher z-value (base + index * 0.1), ensuring newer cards appear on top while maintaining visibility of the pile.

Implementation steps: 1) **Score Display Upgrade**: Replace the current Text2d score displays with SpriteBundle components using the score frame sprites from assets/ui.rs. Position the Greek-bordered score frames at the top corners of the screen, with player names rendered inside using the pixel font. Implement a system to dynamically update the score numbers within the frames. 2) **Turn Indicator Sprite**: Replace the text-based turn indicator with the arrow sprite asset, implementing smooth rotation or translation animations to point at the active player. Use Transform components to animate the arrow's position/rotation. 3) **Deck Counter Visual**: Replace the deck count text with the deck counter sprite frame that includes a card icon. Overlay the remaining card count using the pixel font inside the frame. Position near the deck location. 4) **Kseri Banner Implementation**: Create a system to spawn the Kseri banner sprite when a Kseri capture occurs, with fade-in/fade-out animations using Bevy's color components. The banner should appear prominently in the center of the screen for 2-3 seconds. 5) **Button Sprites Integration**: If any UI buttons exist or are added (like 'Play Again'), replace them with the button sprites that include hover and pressed states. Implement interaction systems to swap textures based on mouse hover/click events. 6) **Sprite Loading System**: Create a centralized UI sprite loading system that loads all UI textures at startup and stores handles in a resource for efficient access. Use texture atlases where appropriate to minimize draw calls. 7) **Layout Adjustments**: Ensure all sprite-based UI elements are properly positioned using Bevy's Transform2D system, maintaining responsive layouts that work at different resolutions while preserving pixel-perfect rendering.",
