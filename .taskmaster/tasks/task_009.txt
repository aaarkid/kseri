# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement WebSocket Client in WASM
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the client-side networking layer for real-time multiplayer communication
# Details:
Implement WebSocket client using web-sys WebSocket API for WASM. Create message protocol for game actions: join game, play card, game state sync. Handle connection lifecycle: connect, disconnect, reconnect. Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff. Serialize game messages using serde_json.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebSocket connection establishment. Verify message serialization/deserialization. Test reconnection logic with simulated disconnects. Verify WASM compatibility in different browsers.
