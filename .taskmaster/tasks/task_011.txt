# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Game State Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the system for keeping game state consistent between server and clients
# Details:
Design efficient state sync protocol sending only deltas when possible. Implement full state sync on connection/reconnection. Create client-side prediction for responsive feel with server reconciliation. Handle conflicting states with server as authority. Add sequence numbers to prevent out-of-order message issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test state consistency with rapid moves. Verify reconnection restores correct state. Test client prediction accuracy. Simulate packet loss and verify recovery. Test with artificial network latency.
